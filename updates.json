In the field of physics, I'm registered for PHYS 2212 Principles of Physics II and PHYS 2213 Introduction to Modern Physics. I'm also unofficially sitting in PHYS 4262 Solid State Physics and PHYS 4143 Quantum Mechanics II for enrichment. For other sciences and engineering courses, I'm in CHEM 1310 Principle of General Chemistry for Engineers, COE 2001 Statics, ME 2016 Computing Techniques, and ECE 3710 Circuits and Electronics. In the field of music, I'm enrolled in MUSI 2011 Fundamentals of Musicianship. I'm also in APPH 1040 to complete the institution health requirement.<br><br>#registration #courses"
