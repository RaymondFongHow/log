For other sciences and engineering courses, I'm in CHEM 1310 Principle of General Chemistry for Engineers, COE 2001 Statics, ME 2016 Computing Techniques, and ECE 3710 Circuits and Electronics. In the field of music, I'm enrolled in MUSI 2011 Fundamentals of Musicianship. I'm also in APPH 1040 to complete the institution health requirement.<br><br>#registration #courses"

I also sat in include PHYS 3122 Electro- and Magnetostatics, then PHYS 3123 Electrodynamics, in which I achieved good understanding of the content and could follow along relevant calculations. Other courses that I sat in occasionally include POL 1101 Government of the United States, MATH 1554 Linear Algebra, MATH 2551 Multivariable Calculus, and MATH 2552 Differential Equations. #courses"
